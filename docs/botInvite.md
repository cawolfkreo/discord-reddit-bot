# How to add a bot to a Discord server?
It's not a hard task. Or at least an easy way to create a link that can help people add your bot to their servers is by using this url: `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXX&scope=bot`. When you use it **Remember to change the `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` part with the Client ID of your Discord app.**. If you made the changes to the url correctly, then people will see a dialog message with your bot invite information and a dropdown they can use in order to pick the server they want to add your bot.
