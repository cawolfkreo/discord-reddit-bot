## Description
This is the code for a **Discord bot** that can mirror reddit posts on discord servers. Right now it's still in development and it's not up for people to use it. But in the near future you can add this bot to your discord server, choose what subreddits to get posts every hour and the bot will **mirror those subreddits** by getting the top posts of them every hour and posting them on an specific channel of your server. 

### Tools used
